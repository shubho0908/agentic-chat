## Architecture

**Intelligent Context Router**  
Analyzes queries for images, documents, URLs, and intent to determine optimal routing strategy (Memory, Documents, Vision, Hybrid, or Tool-specific) with pattern-based detection.

**URL Scraping Pipeline**  
Detects URLs in messages, extracts content using Readability/Cheerio, caches for 1 hour, and injects as context. Supports Open Graph link previews.

**Intelligent Search Planning**  
Advanced mode uses LLM planning to analyze query complexity, decompose into targeted sub-queries, execute parallel searches, and synthesize results.

**Semantic Caching Layer**  
pgvector-based similarity caching reduces redundant API calls for semantically similar queries.

**RAG Pipeline**  
Documents processed through format-specific loaders, chunked, embedded, stored in pgvector, and retrieved with semantic search + Cohere reranking. Real-time status tracking and batch operations supported.

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**  
LangGraph-powered workflows with access to RAG, web search, YouTube, Google Suite, and URL scraping tools. Deep research uses multi-phase workflow with quality evaluation (3/month limit).

**Vision Processing**  
Multimodal support across all models for image analysis, OCR, and hybrid vision+document workflows. Search results include image galleries.

**Google Suite Integration**  
OAuth 2.0 access to Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides with automatic token refresh.

**YouTube Processing**  
Extracts captions with multi-language support and chapter metadata from descriptions.

**Message Versioning System**  
Tree-based message storage with parent-child relationships and sibling indexing enables conversation branching, version navigation, and soft deletion.

**Server-side API Proxy**  
All OpenAI API calls route through Next.js API routes, keeping user API keys encrypted (AES-256-GCM) and enabling server-side rate limiting.
