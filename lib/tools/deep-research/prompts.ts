**CRITICAL RULES - BE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT SKIPPING:**

1. **Skip Research For (say shouldResearch: false):**
   - **Greetings/casual chat**: "Hello", "Hi", "Hey", "How are you?", "What's up?", "Good morning"
   - **Capability questions**: "What can you do?", "How can you help?", "What are your features?"
   - **Basic math**: "What is 2+2?", "Calculate 10% of 500"
   - **Simple definitions**: "What is React?", "Define HTTP", "What does X mean?"
   - **Single facts**: "Who is CEO of Apple?", "When was Python created?", "What is the capital of France?"
   - **Current time/weather**: "What time is it in Tokyo?", "What's the weather?"
   - **Simple conversions**: "Convert 100 USD to EUR"
   - **Yes/No questions with obvious answers**: "Is Python a programming language?"
   - **Very short queries**: Queries under 5 words unless explicitly asking for research
   - **Casual statements**: "That's cool", "Thanks", "Okay", "I see"
   - **Simple how-to with obvious answers**: "How to print in Python?"

2. **Research Required For (say shouldResearch: true):**
   - **Comparison requests**: "Compare X vs Y", "Differences between X and Y"
   - **Analysis requests**: "Analyze the impact of X", "Pros and cons of X"
   - **Complex how/why**: "How does X work in detail?", "Why does X happen comprehensively?"
   - **Current information**: "Latest trends in X", "Recent developments in Y"
   - **Multiple perspectives**: "What do experts think about X?"
   - **Best practices**: "How to implement X properly?", "When to use X vs Y?"
   - **Comprehensive explanations**: Questions clearly needing 500+ words
   - **Explicit research requests**: Contains words like "research", "analyze deeply", "comprehensive"
   - **Complex decision-making**: "Should I use X or Y for my project?" (with context)

3. **Confidence Levels:**
   - **high**: Very clear whether research is needed
   - **medium**: Could go either way - LEAN TOWARD SKIPPING if query is short or simple
   - **low**: Ambiguous - LEAN TOWARD SKIPPING if under 10 words or conversational

**Examples:**

Input: "hy bro how are u"
Output: { "shouldResearch": false, "reason": "Casual greeting, no research needed", "confidence": "high" }

Input: "what can u do"
Output: { "shouldResearch": false, "reason": "Capability question about the AI itself, no external research needed", "confidence": "high" }

Input: "Hello"
Output: { "shouldResearch": false, "reason": "Simple greeting", "confidence": "high" }

**CRITICAL: Deep research is for queries that benefit from multi-source research and comprehensive analysis.**

**Deep Research Required For:**
1. **Comparison Questions**: "What are the differences between X and Y?", "Compare X vs Y", "X or Y - which should I choose?"
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: "Explain the pros and cons of X", "What are the key aspects of X?", "Analyze the impact of X"

4. **Best Practices/Recommendations**: "When should I use X?", "What's the best approach for X?", "How do I decide between X and Y?"
5. **Strategic/Architectural Questions**: Software architecture, system design, technology choices
6. **Trade-off Analysis**: Questions about advantages, disadvantages, considerations, implications
7. **Research Requests**: Contains "research", "analyze", "comprehensive", "detailed", "deep dive", "thorough"
8. **Complex How/Why**: Not simple facts, but questions requiring multi-step explanations with context

**Simple Query Indicators (Only these should be 'simple'):**
- Single fact lookup: "What is X?", "When was X created?", "Who invented X?"
- Definitions: "Define X", "What does X mean?"
- Current status: time, weather, stock prices
- Simple calculations or conversions
- Straightforward "yes/no" questions
- Single-sentence factual answers

**Examples:**

DEEP RESEARCH:
- "What are the key differences between microservices and monolithic architecture, and when should each be used?"
- "Compare React vs Vue: pros, cons, and use cases"
- "Explain the trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL databases"
- "How do I choose between REST and GraphQL for my API?"
- "What are the best practices for implementing authentication?"

SIMPLE:
- "What is React?"
- "When was Python created?"
- "Who is the CEO of Apple?"
- "What time is it in Tokyo?"
- "Convert 100 USD to EUR"
